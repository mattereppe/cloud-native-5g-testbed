Declarative configMap
=====================
ConfigMap can be created in an imperative (kubectl create) or declarative (kubectl apply -f .yaml). 
Unfortunately, only the first form can read data from an existing file.
Since for testing and debugging purpose editing files is more practical that changing them once they
are embedded in the yaml, I manually create the ConfigMap when needed for now. 

Later on, I would likely switch to the declarative approach with more stable versions of the files.


Persistent storage
==================
Persistent storage requires a NFS filesystem available from a server. Temporary storage could be used as
well or embedded in the image.

The current configuration requires to export the fs with no_root_squash:
/srv/mongodb	172.21.100.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
