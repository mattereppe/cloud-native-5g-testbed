Declarative configMap
=====================
ConfigMap can be created in an imperative (kubectl create) or declarative (kubectl apply -f .yaml). 
Unfortunately, only the first form can read data from an existing file.
Since for testing and debugging purpose editing files is more practical that changing them once they
are embedded in the yaml, I manually create the ConfigMap when needed for now. 

Later on, I would likely switch to the declarative approach with more stable versions of the files.
